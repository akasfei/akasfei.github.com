        content: >
          I-S-N stands for Imaging Sequential Network. It is associated with 
          SFEI Systems, which is named after its author, SFEI. It is a website 
          which stores SFEI\'s hightlighted projects as well as a brief 
          introduction of himself.
          \n\n
          ISN features a sequantial layout, including sequence groups, 
          sequences, and sequence nodes. Sequences with different catagories 
          are arranged in different sequence groups and each sequence 
          represents a specific topic. A sequence consists of several nodes, 
          which represents articles explaining the corresponding topic.
          \n\n
          You can use arrow keys, enter and backspace to navigate through 
          the nodes and sequences.

          When a sequence node is active, use ↑ and ↓ keys to navigate through
          other nodes. Use ← and → keys to move to the next or previous sequence.
          Use `ENTER` to active the default button (the blue one), and 
          `BACKSPACE` to move up to the parent sequence.
          \n\n
          When a sequence is active, use ← and → keys to navigate through other 
          sequences. Use ↑ and ↓ keys to activate the last or first node in this
          sequence. Use `ENTER` to active the first node, and `BACKSPACE` to 
          move up to the parent sequence group.
