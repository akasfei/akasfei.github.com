                  <p>I-S-N stands for Imaging Sequential Network. It is associated with SFEI Systems, which is named after its author, SFEI. It is a website which stores SFEI's hightlighted projects as well as a brief introduction of himself.</p>
                  <p>ISN features a sequantial layout, including sequence groups, sequences, and sequence nodes. Sequences with different catagories are arranged in different sequence groups and each sequence represents a specific topic. A sequence consists of several nodes, which represents articles explaining the corresponding topic.</p>
                  <p>You can use arrow keys, enter and backspace to navigate through the nodes and sequences.</p>

                  <p>SFEI Systems v3, codenamed North Star, is an online blog website built with Node.js and Mongodb. It features a twitter-like follow/follower relationship, and SFEI's design concept of 'Imaging Database Network'. It is designed to be the host for SFEI's blogs, thoughts, references, etc.</p>
                  <p><span class="label">NOTE</span> to enter the HUST JingJing website design contest, SFEI applied some minor modifications to this website, including rebranding the website to 'North Star' (the codename) and adding many archive entries associated with the contest. In version 3.3.2, the website will be rebranded to SFEI Systems.</p>
                  <p>Currently SFEI Systems v3 is hosted on <a href="http://northstar.cloudfoundry.com">Cloudfoundry</a>. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/akasfei/North-Star">GitHub.</a></p>

                  <p>Inpsired by the intro movies of Call of Duty Modern Warfare series, an idea of building a private blog website with the name of 'Imaging Database Network' came to mind. I decided to call it 'SFEI Systems', which is also the name of a website I've created before. The project 'SFEI Systems Mk III Imaging Dataabase Network' later became the prototype of the award-winning North Star.</p>
                  <p><span class="label">NOTE</span>The codename of SFEI Systems is 'North Star', but North Star is also the name of a branch of this website. North Star is codenamed 'Deep Earth' and won first place of the HUST JingJing website design contest that took place in Oct 2012 to Jan 2013.</p>
                  <p>SFEI Systems is my first website available to general audience of the Internet. This website will mainly consist of my blogs, thoughts, references, etc. Also recently I've been thinking to convert it into an API server, thus I can access the website's data from multiple applications and platforms.</p>

                  <p>SFEI will keep maintaining this website for a considerable amount of time.</p>
                  <p>In version 3.3.2:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>the webiste will be rebranded to its orginal form, SFEI Systems;</li>
                    <li>some small bugs will be fixed;</li>
                    <li>admins will be able to remove unused tags.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In future versions, 3.4.x or 3.5.x, the website will include an API, which will enable viewing, editing, commenting articles using AJAX. For example, ISN will be able to use a js plugin to fetch new projects from SFEI Systems.</p>

                  <p>Codename Springfield refers to the "Spring Festival Soiree Discovery" topic of Hust <a href="http://focus.hustonline.net">Focus.com.</a>. This project features a journey-like experience that will entertain as well as educate visitors about China's Spring Festival Soiree, aka "Chun wan". This project is designed and developed by me, but all credits should go to the rest of our team who created the website's content.</p>
                  <p>The journey consists of seven parts: introduction, the jury of performance, the fantastic effects, the pointer of fashion, the manufacturer of stars, the display of culture, and the epilogue. Each part, other than the first and the last part, consists of several articles of a specific topic.</p>
                  <p>This project was officially released on Mar 30, 2013.</p>

                  <p>As this project is mainly associated to China's Spring Festival, during which red decorations are very common, the main tone of this website is set to red. Also, there is a red square around the edge of the page, and some decorations at each corner. These decorations are intended to imitate a traditional Chinese window design.</p>
                  <p>When users click the buttons or links, the next page will slide horizontally into the screen, giving users the impression that they on a journey. An image and some description are shown for each part, and if users intend to know more about the topic, they can click the "Learn more" link, which will show an iframe containing the articles of that topic.</p>
                  <p>The main carousel hides to show the iframe, and a navigation bar is provided to navigate among the iframe pages. In each iframe page, there is a navigation pane at the left. This pane contains titles of all articles on this page.</p>

                  <p>The assetbase is created to be a host for several js libries including jQuery, bootstrap, and backbone.js.</p>
                  <p>This website provides three popular JavaScript libaries. It is designed because I cannot tolerate the latency of ajax.google.com in mainland China (the reason is quite clear). This website supports both http and https.</p>
                  <p>Generally speaking, when users request a file without other requests (for example /jQuery/), the server reads its cache and send the file back. It is also possible to request a file of specific version, and whether it should be compressed.</p>

                  <p>The A World without Holidays trilogy is about a persistant struggle of a group of students (the NOVICE) against the evil faction (the MENTORS), who intend to use their power and influence to cancel all holidays and achieve their evil goal of nation-wide domination. The story focuses on two of the students, who discovered, investigated and finally sabotaged the MENTORS' plot.</p>
                  <p>The first part of the trilogy was shot in 2009, while the second and third part are rendered using World of Warcraft graphics engine in 2011 and 2012. Due to some complicated reasons, only the third part is publicly released.</p>

                <article>
                  <p>The story of A World without Holidays is based the irony on China's current high school education system, in which students have a sole goal to fight for: the Colledge Entrance Examination. In order to achieve better score, students are usually required to study longer and take more classes. The story of the trilogy starts with a direct conflict between the two faction, both are trying to obtain an artifact to achieve their own goals. The conflict, however, led to the disappearance of the artifact. The two factions had no choice but to negotiate peace.</p>
                  <p>Five years later, a third faction named Al'Asad Education appeared and posed great threat to both faction. So the school selected some students and formed Task Force 320, who later discovered that the school wished only to benefit from the conflict. TF320 stopped cooperating with the school, and as a consequence, they were ambushed, captured and later executed. However, a member of TF320 was rescued by a stranger and survived.</p>
                  <p>Finally, with the help of some students, two heroes are able to sabotage the organization of the MENTORS. They took down the MENTORS' defences piece by piece, and they finally succeeded in putting the leader of the MENTORS out of rule.</p>

                  <p>Five years later, A third faction appeared. Named Al'Asad Education, they claimed that their classes can improve the students' exam score. The MENTORS selected three students and formed Task Force 320, and sent them to investigate the third faction. During an undercover mission, a member of the Task Force was captured.</p>
                  <p>As the investigation goes on, the Task Force found an unusual connection between the third faction and the MENTORS. In the same time, Al'Asad Education managed to turn a radical group of students against the school. During a raid to a base of Al'Asad Education, TF320 rescued their captured member and tried to cease the destructive uprising.</p>
                  <p>Fearing that TF320 might have discovered their plot, the MENTORS ambushed TF320. All but one menber were captured and executed. The last member of TF320, named Shrink, was rescued by a stranger, who later turned out to be Dongqi Wang, the hero from episode 1.</p>

                  <p>A month after episode 2, the radical group launched an attack on the school's facilites. The uprising was supressed by brute force, and using it as an excuse, the MENTORS announced that all holidays will be cancelled. In the same time, Dongqi Wang and Shrink came up with a plan that will take down the MENTORS' insitituion step by step.</p>
                  <p>With the help of some menbers of the NOVICE, they managed to sabotage the MENTORS' main military force and financial income. However, in order to confront the leader of the MENTORS, Wang had to deliberately walk into a trap. Wang sacrificed himself for a chance to strike.</p>
                  <p>After officially joining the NOVICE, Shrink infaltrated the office of the MENTORS, where he defeated the leader of the MENTORS. The leader of the NOVICE, in the same time, assassinated the leader of Al'Asad Education. Finally, using the power of Weizi Stamp, they were able to restore the school to its previous glory.</p>

                  <p>I have used some of my favourite soundtracks in this video, including Ezio's Family. In the epilogue, two girls were talking about the meaning of the past three years when the music fade in, and with the image of our school slowly moving out of sight, the audience realise that they will leave the place they lived and studied. The whole scene was very moving.</p>
                  <p>The epilogue was adapted from Assassin's Creed II, the night before the tragedy fell upon his family. He and his brother climbed up a tower, and said:</p>
                  <p>-"It is a good life we lead, brother." -"The best. May it never change." -"And may it never change us."</p>

                  <p>As this projects consists of four topics, I assigned a color to each topic, and use the specific color in the corresponding section. Atop the page a placed a carousel, which will display a typical image of each topic. As all articles were arranged in the same page, there is a navigation pane at the left of the page, which displays the current location by hightlighting a link.</p>
                  <p>It's worth noting that some users complained that the practice of putting all articles in the same page is "too crowded".</p>
                  <p>Overall, I believe this project is of average, and it represents my design style at the time of the making of this project.</p>

                  <p>The design of this webpage is inspired by the DNA Tracker of the Assassin's Creed Series. Like the DNA tracker, this webpage has mulitple sequences available to expand and read the information in each node.</p>
                  <p>With the increase in the amount of the seuqences, some sequence will eventually move out of the screen. That's why when moving to the sequence on the right, the sequence container will move left a bit, thus making the active sequence located around the middle of the screen.</p>
                  <p>Currently this webpage is static. But after the development of my API Server (possibly SFEI Systems v3.5.x) I will add a js plugin that will fetch new projects from my server.</p>

                  <p>As I am still a student in college, I cannot take many business requests. But if you'd like to give me a design/development job, I will welcome that. Currently I can accept two types of jobs: design (poster, book cover, or other 2d design) and develop (web front-end). You can send the details of your project to <a href="mailto:akasfei@gmail.com">akasfei@gmail.com</a></p>

                  <p>I'm always eager to hear from people of the same interest. If you'd like to pick up a chat with me, I will most certainly welcome. Please send an email to: <a href="mailto:akasfei@gmail.com">akasfei@gmail.com</a></p>
